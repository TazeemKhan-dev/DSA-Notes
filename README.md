# 🧠 DSA Notes – Structured Problem-Solving in Java  

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms Notes Repository** —  
a structured and comprehensive collection of **DSA problems**, solutions, and approaches written in **Java**, formatted for **clarity, depth, and quick revision**.

## 📚 What’s Inside

Each problem note follows a **consistent, easy-to-navigate structure**:

- **Problem Understanding** – clear explanation of what’s being asked.  
- **Constraints** – important limits on input and output.  
- **Edge Cases** – tricky situations you shouldn’t miss.  
- **Examples** – input/output patterns and reasoning.  
- **Approaches** – one or more ways to solve the problem:
  - 🧩 Idea  
  - 🔢 Step-by-step logic  
  - 💻 Java Code (with clean formatting)  
  - ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity  
- **Justification / Proof** – why the solution is optimal.  
- **Variants** – related problems or extensions.  
- **💡 Tips & Observations** – conceptual takeaways & patterns.

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository is meant for:
- 🚀 **Quick revision before interviews.**  
- 🧩 **Deep conceptual understanding** of each pattern.  
- 🧠 **Consistent DSA documentation** for personal growth and sharing.  

Every note is **self-contained** — you can open any `.md` file and directly read the structured explanation.
