the structure will be like this

Problem Understanding 

Constraints 
Edge Cases

Examples 

Approaches (Approach 1, Approach 2, etc., including Idea,steps, java code, and Complexity)

Justification (Proof of Optimality or comparison of approaches)

Variants (Follow-Ups, related problems)

Problem Understanding → Constraints → Edge Cases → Examples → Approaches → Justification → Variants → Tips & Observations

Merge the following [number of questions] into one combined DSA note. 
I want the note in this **exact format**:

1. **Problem Understanding**
   - Brief description of all variants/problems.
   - State clearly what each variant asks.

2. **Constraints**
   - Include input limits and special conditions.

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Include all obvious and tricky edge cases.

4. **Examples**
   - Give at least 2–3 examples.
   - Include visual representation (like triangle/array) if applicable.
   - Show output for all variants.

5. **Approaches**
   - **Approach 1: Brute Force**
       - Idea
       - Steps
       - Java code for Variant I
       - Java code for Variant II
       - Java code for Variant III
       - Complexity for each variant
   - **Approach 2: Better / Improved**
       - Idea
       - Steps
       - Java code for Variant I
       - Java code for Variant II
       - Java code for Variant III
       - Complexity for each variant
   - **Approach 3: Optimal / Most Efficient**
       - Idea
       - Steps
       - Java code for Variant I
       - Java code for Variant II
       - Java code for Variant III
       - Complexity for each variant

6. **Justification**
   - Compare all approaches.
   - Mention which is suitable for which scenario.

7. **Variants / Follow-Ups**
   - List all possible follow-up problems or related variations.

8. **Tips & Observations**
   - Always include meaningful insights, shortcuts, patterns.
   - Include mathematical properties or relations.

**Notes:**
- Place **Tips & Observations at the very end**.  
- Ensure code for each variant is separated and clearly labeled.  
- Show complexities for each variant.  
- Include visuals in examples where helpful.  

Use this template for [problem type]. Make it clean, structured, and exam/revision-ready.


// multiple problems
Problem Understanding – Explain each variant clearly, what it asks, and key differences.

Constraints – Include array/input sizes, value ranges, special conditions.

Edge Cases – Include tricky and boundary cases, duplicates, impossible sums, empty/small inputs.

Examples – Provide at least 2–3 examples per variant. Show input, output, explanation, and sorted results if needed.

Approaches – Include 3 approaches, each with:

Approach 1: Brute Force

Idea

Steps

Combined code for all variants in one method or unified logic

Complexity (Time + Space) for each variant in bullet points

Approach 2: Better / Improved

Idea

Steps

Combined code for all variants

Complexity (Time + Space) for each variant

Approach 3: Optimal / Most Efficient

Idea

Steps

Combined code for all variants (recursive/generalized if needed)

Complexity (Time + Space) for each variant

Justification – Compare approaches in bullet points, explain which is better and why.

Variants / Follow-Ups – List related or extended problems.

Tips & Observations – Include insights, shortcuts, patterns, and best practices.

Additional Rules:

Language: Java

Include only useful comments in code.

Use bullet points everywhere, no tables.

Code should be combined per approach, not separate for each variant.

Show Time and Space complexity for each variant in bullet points.

Keep explanations concise, structured, and clear.
